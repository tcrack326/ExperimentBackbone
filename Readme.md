## Experiment with Backbone

This is a project using Backbone for Assignment 15 at the Iron Yard.  It is a list of cars that can added to and ideally deleted using Backbone.  Currently, the models are not being destroyed using Backbone but will be in the future when I learn more about the framework.

This uses the following JavaScript libraries: Backbone, jQuery, underscore.js, and modernizr.js
